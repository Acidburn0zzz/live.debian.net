# live-config 3.0 Todo

### small

  * check sdm, xdm, wdm.
  * factor out netbase (3.x).
  * use live/config/* as scripts too.
  * check preseeding for xserver-xorg.

### bigger

  * makeing plugins infrastructure self-contained
  * making plugins post- and pre- login processing
  * verify modifications with a d-i sample installation.
  * allow some scripts (most prominently locales) to be run even in persistent mode.
  * use verbose/quiet/interactive modes for scripts.
  * use logfile.
  * enable display managers only if they are the selected one.
  * add option to specify the xsession.
  * when not using persistency, do not import options into the debconf db.
  * cleanup the scripts order and splitting.
  * check if we have the most important scripts for ubuntu so that live-config supports both.
