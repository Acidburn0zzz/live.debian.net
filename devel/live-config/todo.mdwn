# live-config: Todo

### regressions

Everything that worked with live-initramfs works with live-boot/live-config, except for the following things:

* temporarily no serial console support during booting. this will be added back in some time.
* the locale script temporarily doesn't automatically configures the keyboard when a 'short' locale is specified (like locales=de).

### small

  * factor out netbase (4.x).

### medium

  * live-debconfig:
    - integrate support for systemd
    - integrate support for upstart
    - disable udev
    - disable update-initramfs
  * live-config-upstart:
    - reimplement based on the way https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/friendly-recovery/ interacts with upstart,
      see also http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2013/05/msg01288.html

### bigger

  * making plugins post- and pre- login processing
  * verify modifications with a d-i sample installation.
  * allow some scripts (most prominently locales) to be run even in persistent mode.
  * use verbose/quiet/interactive modes for scripts.
  * use logfile.
  * enable display managers only if they are the selected one.
  * when not using persistency, do not import options into the debconf db.
  * cleanup the scripts order and splitting.
  * check if we have the most important scripts for ubuntu so that live-config supports both.
