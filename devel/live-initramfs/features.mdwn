# live-initramfs Features

## Boot methods

  * Optical media (cd, dvd, bd) and nested images
  * Mass storage (usb-zip, usb-hdd) and nested images
  * Network filesystems (nfs, smb/cifs, afs) and nested images
  * Network protocols (http, ftp, rsync)
  * Network devices (nbd, aoe, iscsi)
  * Local filesystems (ext2-4 etc.), as image and plain.
  * Allow to include system completely in initrd.img (like debirf).
  * Allow tunneling (ssh, openvpn, ike) when network is needed to access the root filesystem.

## Boot process

  * One time argument handling (with proper respect of live.conf, also from /live/live.conf)
  * One time function handling
  * Split out late user space to dedicated package (live-initscripts)
  * Distributor specific mode for overloading of functions
  * Release specific compatibility/legacy handling during package build-time
  * i18n/l10n support during early userspace (gettext, po4a)
  * Splash support (plymouth, splashy)
  * Use initramfs keyb functions, rather than re-implenting wheels

## Features

  * Redo persistency from scratch
  * Allow to clear persistency (by reformating the partition) through live-initramfs (for the firmware trick: factory reset).
  * cryptsetup for persistency layer
  * persistency layer on network shares, global and per user.
  * Improved toram (awk progressbar or something like that)
  * Redo login manager support (kdm, gdm, nodm, plain startx on tty1)

## Bugs

  * (Almost) whatever is listed in the BTS :)

## General

  * Document stuff properly, both the actual implementation and its customization
  * Use sane coding style consistently
  * Optimize sh calls for speed and simplicity
  * Think about implementing parts of it that are performance critical in C
  * Drop unused, overly complicated features
  * Synchronise and unify boot parameters
