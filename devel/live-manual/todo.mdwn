# live-manual Todo

  * put every volatile content (such as temporary hacks, wishlists etc) to ikiwiki on live.d.n.
  * put every 'more or less stable' documentation stuff into live-manual
  * update all references to wiki.d.o/DebianLive to their new location
  * add test target that can be run live.debian.net and which sends mail to the mailinglist in case of build failures.
