# RFC - Package Validation

## Overview

In order to implement 'Constant Usable Testing (CUT)' from a live point of view,
we would need a possibility to handle non-installable packages gracefully.

First, we'll need a way for apt to not fail on unavailable packages and skip that.

Second, it would be nice to have some sort of 'diff' between the previous build,
so we can see what changed.
