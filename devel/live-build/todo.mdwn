# live-build 3.0 Todo

### misc

  * gtk d-i true for squeeze
  * volatile, backports
  * btrfs support
  * extlinux support -> check d-i from ext partitions in cdrom-detect
  * tmpfs support
  * implement globaly shared caches
  * update d-i handling for new Xorg based gui installer
  * fuers cgi die configs in ein repo pushen, so dass es dann via cgi kommt
  * fix build failures with -p minimal and local packages
  * add extlinux as bootloader
  * binary_debian-installer fails when cpi is not available (should use chrooted cpio)
  * update to use syslinux-themes-debian
  * rethink sources.list and sources.list.d handling.
  * trusted keys from local repository are not removed again.
  * finish usb-zip support.
  * finish grub on usb.
  * fix size issues in the desktop images (tasksel usage screwup).
  * "common" source packages must include other architectures packages (e.g. bootloaders) too.
  * using menu beep when syslinux prompt is ready.
  * build 'all-in-one' dvd.
  * finish image-name option and other temporary branches.
  * think about prebuilt alternatives images with grub instead of syslinux.
  * zsync files for snapshots? cdimage.d.o appears to drop them anyway due to a bug with zsync that makes it useless (see debian-cd ml archive for details).
  * make lb invocation to build installer-only images possible.

### core

  * us lh as generic exec wrapper
  * add bash completion.
  * create log file per default
  * support global cache in /var/cache/live-build
  * parse options only once
  * parse config only once
  * review all config value names, use ini format for config tree and stabilize it
  * finish documentation and manpages
  * allow to completely build off-line from cache, including 'faked' indices for remote mirrors.
  * allow to build for cross-architectures (binfmt where possible, otherwise two stage debootstrap with qemu emulation).
  * interactive mode should set debconf frontends to interactive and priority to low.
  * merge different tarball compressions into tar-gz, tar-bz2, etc., same way as usb-hdd and usb-zip.
  * merge different checksums into one function, and make configurable which hash to use.
  * support building multiple binary images in a row.
  * support building images without root (fakeroot, fakechroot, sudo etc).
  * improve webfrontend, use http://linuxcoe.sourceforge.net/ for inspiration.
  * add a flag to make use of tmpfs for the build directory automatically.

### config

  * create --report-config option
  * create --validate-config option
  * provide config auto update:
    * s/enabled/true/g; s/disable/false/g
    * s/categories/archive-areas/
    * local packageslists changes:
      * config/chroot_local-packageslists/foo to config/chroot_local-packageslists/foo.list
      * any *.list doesn't need to be in LH_PACKAGES_LISTS anymore
      * any list in LH_PACKAGES_LISTS needs to have a suffix *.list
    * scripts/ renamed to auto/
  * define modes by dropping files with variables into modes.d/ directory
  * improve Check_defaults() to cover more wrong combinations/values
  * improve --clone (see bootcd for inspiration).

### cgi

  * add debconf prompts to make setup automatic
  * add FAQ to index page
  * remove unavailable packages from apt list
  * fix debian-live packages lists

### binary_debian-installer

  * populate bootloader configuration with both regular netinstall and
    live-installer entries.

### binary_rootfs

  * support partial squashfs images
  * review pre-cached chroot mechanism and fix regression with config/binary_rootfs/excludes
  * support read-ahead and squashfs -sort

### binary_usb

  * add usb-zip and usb-gpt support.

### binary_syslinux

  * redo configfile stuff
  * use custom theming from /usr/share/$bootloader-theme-$foo
  * add gfxboot helper
  * add extlinux support

### chroot_linux-image

  * make initrd compression configurable, e.g. lzma instead of gzip.
  * divert update-initramfs during chroot stage, only (re)build initrd once in chroot_hacks.

### source

  * make source images apt-get'able
  * also cache source packages to avoid re-downloading
  * introduce source mirrors so that we can have mirrors to fetch source packages from being different from those where we fetch debs from (not all mirrors carry sources, unfortunately).
