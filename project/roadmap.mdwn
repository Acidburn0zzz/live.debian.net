    - having embedded the syslinux config
    - having the upgrade for lb2->lb3
    - having the packages renamed to make sure stuff is coinstallable
    - /live to /lib/live/ move (that affects d-i only, though)
    - apt-file hook wrt/ order of hooks
    - rename renaming dirs in config tree
    - rename options in config tree
