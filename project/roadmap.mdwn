# Roadmap

## Short Term (matter of days)

live-helper:

  * rethink sources.list and sources.list.d handling.
  * trusted keys from local repository are not removed again.
  * finish usb-zip support.
  * finish grub on usb.
  * fix size issues in the desktop images (tasksel usage screwup).
  * "common" source packages must include other architectures packages (e.g. bootloaders) too.
  * using menu beep when syslinux prompt is ready.
  * build 'all-in-one' dvd.
  * finish image-name option and other temporary branches.

other:

  * think about prebuilt alternatives images with grub instead of syslinux.
  * zsync files for snapshots? cdimage.d.o appears to drop them anyway due to a bug with zsync that makes it useless (see debian-cd ml archive for details).

## Middle Term (matter of weeks)

  * release squeeze beta1.
  * start implementing live-initramfs 2.0.
  * clone brendans setup for autotesting on live.debian.net.

## Long Term (matter of months)

  * release final live-helper 2.0.
  * release final live-initramfs 2.0.
