# Roadmap

## Debian 8.0 "jessie" aka live-* 4.x

  * live-boot:
    - finish scripts transition.
    - add port to dracut.

  * live-build:
    - finalize on dpkg/debhelper-ish config tree layout.
    - support building multiple images combinations from one config tree and in a row.

  * live-config:
    - use live-debconfig for everything.
    - improve support when being run with persistence (so that still the system is 'reconfigured' on boot).

## Debian 9.0 "no-name-yet" aka live-* 5.x

  * live-build:
    - rewrite in Python to have proper interfaces for future GUI and web frontends.
