# Roadmap

## Debian 7.0 "wheezy" aka live-* 3.x

  * [Remaining issues to be solved for the wheezy release](/devel/rfc/wheezy/)

## Debian 8.0 "jessie" aka live-* 4.x

  * live-*:
    - check everything to use conf.d really everywhere (interfaces.d, fstab.d, etc.).
    - debian de-branding, make it as nice as possible for derivatives.

  * live-boot:
    - finish scripts transition.
    - add port to dracut.
    - add support for 'new' roofs encryption using losetup with cryptoloop et al.

  * live-build:
    - finalize on dpkg/debhelper-ish config tree layout.
    - support building multiple images combinations from one config tree and in a row.
    - support building foreign binary images in proper.

  * live-build/live-boot:
    - include an ext4 secondary partition on the image (10mb or so) configured for persistence and resize it on first boot with persistence from within live-boot.

  * live-config:
    - use live-debconfig for everything.
    - improve support when being run with persistence (so that still the system is 'reconfigured' on boot).

## Debian 9.0 "no-name-yet" aka live-* 5.x

  * live-build:
    - rewrite in Python to have proper interfaces for future GUI and web frontends.
