# About

A Debian Live system is a [Debian](http://www.debian.org/) operating system that does not require a classical installer to use it. It comes on various media, including [CD-ROM](http://wiki.debian.org/DebianLive/Howto/ISO), [USB sticks](http://wiki.debian.org/DebianLive/Howto/USB), or via [netboot](http://wiki.debian.org/DebianLive/Howto/Network_Image_Server). [Why Debian Live?](http://live.debian.net/manual/html/about.html)

Although the Debian Live project is about the framework to create your own customized Live system, we offer some prebuilt images. Currently, builds for four desktop environments ([GNOME](http://www.gnome.org/), [KDE](http://www.kde.org/), [LXDE](http://www.lxde.org/), and [Xfce](http://www.xfce.org/)) as well as the standard system and for rescue purposes are vailable.
